# PHP Code Challenge

### Requirements

Build a basic HTTP API web application using the PHP technologies of your choice. You will be evaluated on your ability to *architect* a miniature application.

The web application will be responsible for returning the following information serialized as JSON:

1. Geolocation information:
    * Target IP address (use client IP if none specified)
    * City/State/Country of IP
2. Weather information using the geolocated city of the target IP address
    * Current temperature (in **celcius**)
    * Wind speeds

For IP Geolocation, your application should use the following two free services:

1. [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com/)
2. [freegeoip.net](http://freegeoip.net/)

The client should be able to use different geolocation services based on a query parameter (?service=ip-api, or ?service=freegeoip) if provided, but default to one of them if nothing is specified. The response should also contain a value indicating to the client which service was used to return the Geolocation response.

For weather information, you should use the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/current) to get the current weather information for a city by name. You may use our API key: `6103b0f582e78c7382bc6b0cdc06deb8`.

> **NOTE:** Our OpenWeatherMap API key has a rate limit of 60 requests/minute. If you are throttled, you need to wait a full minute before it will work again.

### Endpoints

##### `GET /geolocation`

##### `GET /geolocation/:ip_address`

##### `GET /weather`

##### `GET /weather/:ip_address`

### Sample Requests

```
GET /geolocation
```

```json
{
    "ip": "8.8.8.8",
    "geo": {
        "service": "ip-api",
        "city": "Mountain View",
        "region": "California",
        "country": "United States"
    }
}
```

```
GET /weather/8.8.8.8
```

```json
{
    "ip": "8.8.8.8",
    "city": "Mountain View",
    "temperature": {
        "current": 13,
        "low": 11,
        "high": 16,
    },
    "wind": {
        "speed": 11,
        "direction": 240
    }
}
```

### Instructions

1. Begin by forking this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Create your PHP implementation of the requirements above, committing your code as you progress
3. When finished, open a Pull Request to [lxrco/php-code-challenge-a](https://github.com/lxrco/php-code-challenge-a)

### Remarks

Feel free to use any technology you want or add features you think would make it better.

We're looking for developers who:
* are comfortable relying on high-quality existing packages and knowing when is the appropriate time to use them
* take pride in their creation instead of rushing to get it through the door
* commit often and showcase work through a descriptive commit history

Bonus points if you cover unit and/or functional testing.

Happy coding!
